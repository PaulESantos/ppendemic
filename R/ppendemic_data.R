#' ppendemic_tab14: Endemic Plant Database of Peru
#'
#' The ppendemic_tab14 dataset is a tibble (data frame) that provides easy access
#' to a comprehensive database of Peru's endemic plant species. It contains a total
#' of 7,898 records with essential botanical information, including the accepted
#' name, accepted family, genus, species, infraspecific information, taxon authors,
#' primary author, place of publication, volume and page, publication years, and
#' version details.

#' @details The dataset provides a curated and up-to-date collection of Peru's
#' endemic plant species, gathered from reputable botanical sources and publications.
#' The data for this database was extracted and compiled from the World Checklist
#' of Vascular Plants (WCVP) database, which is a comprehensive and reliable
#' repository of botanical information.
#'
#' This version (ppendemic_tab14) includes enhanced temporal information with
#' separate numeric fields for actual and nominal publication years. This allows for more
#' precise bibliographic tracking and citation accuracy. The dataset also includes
#' improved infraspecific taxonomy handling with dedicated fields for ranks and
#' epithets.
#'
#' The year extraction process uses sophisticated pattern matching to distinguish
#' between actual publication years and nominal years, with the has_different_years
#' field automatically flagging records where these differ. This is particularly
#' important for historical botanical publications where publication delays were
#' common.
#'
#'
#' @source The dataset has been carefully compiled and updated to offer the latest
#' insights into Peru's endemic plant species. The data is sourced from the World
#' Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP) database, an international collaborative
#' programme initiated in 1988 by RafaÃ«l Govaerts that provides high-quality
#' expert-reviewed taxonomic data on all vascular plants.

#' Vascular Plants, a continuously updated resource for exploring global plant
#' diversity" in Nature Scientific Data.
