El objetivo de ppendemic es brindar acceso a la información de "El libro rojo de las plantas endémicas del Perú. Blanca León et al 2006", mediante un grupo de herramientas que permiten evaluar si nuestros registros contienen especies endémicas del Perú. 

The goal of ppendemic is to gives access to the "El libro rojo de las plantas endémicas del Perú. Blanca León et al 2006", with a set of functions to validate if you have endemic plants in your plants records.

## Installation

You can install the released version of ppendemic from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ppendemic")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(ppendemic)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
