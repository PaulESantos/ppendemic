\title{Check if species are endemic in the ppendemic database}
\usage{
is_ppendemic(splist, max_distance = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{splist}{A character vector containing the list of species names to be checked for
endemism in the ppendemic database.}

\item{max_distance}{A numeric value (default is 0.1) specifying the maximum distance
for fuzzy matching. It should be a non-negative value.}
}
\value{
A character vector indicating if each species is endemic, not endemic, or
if it is an endemic species found using fuzzy matching.
}
\description{
This function checks if a list of species names are endemic in the ppendemic database.
Endemic species are those that are native and restricted to a specific geographic area,
in this case, Peru. The function allows fuzzy matching for species names with a maximum
distance threshold to handle potential typos or variations in species names.
